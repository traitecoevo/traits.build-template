  description: Leaf-level photosynthetic parameters of species in the closely related
    genera Eucalyptus and Corymbia were assessed along a strong rainfall gradient
    in northern Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Leaf gas exchange measurements were made at six sites along a
    sub-continental rainfall gradient in northern Australia (Fig. 1). The sites covered
    a latitudinal range from approximately 12 deg S to 23 deg S, with corresponding
    MAP ranging from approximately 1700 mm to 300 mm (Table 1). Two canopy tree species
    characteristic of each site were selected for measurements. All of the selected
    species were from the genus Eucalyptus, or the closely related genus Corymbia
    (Table 1). Two individuals of each of the two species at each site were selected
    for measurements. A total of six leaves were sampled from each species at each
    site. Canopy access was achieved with a 16 m elevated work platform at the four
    more northerly sites, and with ladders or from the ground at the two more southerly
    sites where trees were shorter.

  trait_name: leaf_photosynthetic_rate_per_area_saturated
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: Two portable photosynthesis systems
    (Li-6400, LiCor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) were used to measure the response of photosynthesis
    to intercellular CO2 concentration (A-ci curve).
    The two systems were cross calibrated, and gave unbiased results with respect
    to each other. The measurement sequence for each sampled leaf started with the
    A-ci curve and then proceeded to the light response curve. The CO2 concentration
    (umol mol-1) entering the leaf gas exchange cuvette was altered in the following
    sequence, 400, 280, 230, 150, 70, 40, 230, 400, 640, 980, and 1200. A measurement
    of photosynthesis was logged approximately 2 min after each step change in CO2
    concentration entering the cuvette. Irradiance during the A-ci curve measurements
    was set at 2000 umol photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) m-2 s-1, supplied
    by an artificial light source (6400-02B LED, LiCor Inc.).
