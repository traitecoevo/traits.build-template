  replicates: 5
  methods: Five leaves were collected and pressed for measurements of width, area
    and SLA. Leaves were taken from full-light situations and, where possible, from
    random branches on separate individuals (see Westoby 1998, appendix, for discussion
    of protocols for characterizing leaves and height). Leaf outline images were captured
    by HP DeskScan II scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, USA) and quantified by
    Delta-T SCAN image analysis software (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK)
