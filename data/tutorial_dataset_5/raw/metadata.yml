  description: An investigation of the extent of plasticity and the adaptive value 
    thereof in water use traits in three herbaceous Australian alpine plant species
    to understand how these species will respond to projected climate change.

  sampling_strategy: 'Seed collection and germination Seeds from three alpine herbs;
    Aciphylla glacialis (F. Muell.) Benth. (Apiaceae), Oreomyrrhis eriopoda (DC.)
    Hood.f. (Apiaceae), and Wahlenbergia ceracea Lothian (Campanulaceae), were collected
    from Kosciuszko National Park, New South Wales, Australia between December 2009
    and April 2010 (Additional file 1: Figure S1). For each species, seeds were collected
    from 30 individual plants within their natural distribution (ranging from 1600
    to 2200 m a.s.l,). Seeds were germinated over winter between May and August 2010
    under controlled conditions at the Australian National Botanic Gardens, Canberra.
    From these seedlings, replicates of four to six maternal lines from the upper
    and lower 25% of the elevation distribution (henceforth referred to as high and
    low elevation) of each species were selected for the experiment (Table 1). Seedlings
    were grown under common conditions in 50 mm/0.2 l pots containing commercial seed
    raising mix with micronutrients (Debco Pty Ltd., Victoria, Australia) in the nursery
    for approximately six months with some variation among species depending upon
    germination timing. Experimental design: Glasshouse conditions In March 2011 (autumn),
    370 seedlings were transplanted from the nursery into glasshouse conditions with
    ambient light conditions and a temperature set to cool alpine conditions of 20/10
    deg C day/night with a natural light cycle. Seedlings were potted into 175 mm
    diameter/2.8 l pots containing a mix of 80:10:10; commercial potting mix: field
    soil: and washed river sand with added slow release osmocote for natives (Debco
    Pty Ltd., Victoria, Australia). Field soil was used to provide the seedlings with
    a natural inoculum, and was collected from a site within the Kosciuszko National
    Park where all three species co-occur. Initial leaf number was counted and seedlings
    of uniform size were selected from each maternal line to minimize variance within
    and between lines for each species. Following time to adjust to transplanting,
    pairs of seedlings were allocated to three blocks in a stratified design (May
    2011); one member of each pair was randomly assigned to a wellwatered treatment,
    and the other to a dry treatment. Seedlings were placed on a bench in a randomized
    design (minimum n = 2 per block), however, due to variation in germination and
    establishment success the design was not perfectly balanced (Table 1). High and
    low water treatments were applied using a Water-Pro vapour pressure deficit (VPD)
    controlled system (MicroGrow GreenHouse Systems, Temecula, California), with each
    plant watered individually by a dripper at soil level [33]. Drippers were calibrated
    to a standard flow rate that was checked at the beginning and end of the experiment.
    Watering events were triggered when pre-set VPD targets were reached. High water
    plants received ~160 ml per watering (enough to saturate the soil); low water
    plants received ~80 ml per watering. Watering occurred roughly once per week for
    low water plants and every 2-3 days for high water plants, depending on VPD in
    the glasshouse. Under this regime, low water plants received ~25% of that which
    the high water plants received. '

  methods: Gas exchange was measured using a LiCor 6400 portable photosynthesis system
    (LiCor, Lincoln, Neb) after 6 months of growth (26/11/2011 to 16/12/2011). On
    each plant, a young fully expanded leaf was selected for measurement. Measurements
    were taken at two time points; on the morning following a watering event (wet
    cycle) when the plants were at their least water-limited, and on the final day
    of a watering cycle (dry cycle) when the low water plants were at the driest point
    in the cycle. Block temperature was set at ~20 deg C, CO2 was 400 ppm, relative
    humidity was maintained around 60% and light levels were 500 umol m2 s. Preliminary
    assessment indicated that this light level was saturating. Photosynthetic measurements
    were done between 8:00 till 13:00 h, before stomatal closure.

  methods: Leaf samples were taken to measure leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA,
    cm-2 g-1) at the time of gas exchange measurements. Collected leaves were placed
    with petioles positioned in saturated florist foam and kept at 4 deg C in the
    dark overnight before being weighed to determine saturated weight, scanned on
    a flatbed scanner, and dried at 60 deg C for 72 h before being weighed again to
    determine dry weight. Leaf size was calculated as an area (cm2/per leaf), and
    specific leaf area was calculated as area/dry mass (cm-2 g-1).

  methods: For each species by elevation combination that had been measured for photosynthesis,
    replicates from three to four maternal lines were selected for isotope analysis.
    From these lines, three replicates from each of the high and low water treatments
    were chosen to be measured from each block (n = 112). Carbon isotopic (d13C) and
    elemental analysis (%N) were performed on an isochrome continuous flow stable
    isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Micromass, Middlewich, England).
