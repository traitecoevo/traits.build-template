        rate.
      comments: Leaf temperature and leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit should be
        recorded as context properties. If Tleaf and VPD are not reported, it is assumed
        measurements are made at typical temperature and VPD conditions for the plant.

        water potential of a plant's shoot system just before sunrise, a proxy for
        soil water potential and the plant's highest (least negative) water potential
        for the day.
      comments: Predawn water potential is often assumed to equal the soil water potential,
        but the plant's water potential does not necessarily equilibrate with soil
        water potential overnight. It is therefore better considered a "proxy" of
        soil water potential.

      description: A whole plant morphology trait [TO:0000398] which is the maximum
        [NCIT:C25564] vertical [PATO:0001854] height [PATO:0000119] of the vegetative
        shoot system [PO:0025607] for a taxon [NCIT:C40098] in a given population
        [PCO:0000001] or location [NCIT:C25341].;Maximum vertical height of the vegetative
        shoot system for a taxon in a given location.
      comments: This trait is not meant to document the height of all individuals
        sampled, but instead the maximum height for a typical mature individual within
        a population or across a taxon. The trait should only be scored for self-supporting
        plants, not climbers whose height is dependent on the surrounding vegetation.
        The documented height should be the maximum height achieved by vegetative
        shoots, not the height reached by reproductive shoots, as it represents the
        plant's access to light.

        area [PATO:0001323] of the leaf lamina [PO:0020039] and petiole [PO:0020038].
        For some species the area of a leaf analogue is reported, possibly a leaflet
        [PO:0020049], cladode [PO:0025354], or phyllode [PO:0025335].;The 2-dimensional
        projected (scanned) area of the surface of a leaf or a leaf analogue (leaflet,
        cladode, phyllode).
      comments: This trait includes measurements of leaves and leaf analogues, including
        leaflets, cladodes, and phyllodes. When a measurement is made on a leaf analogue,
        the tissue measured should be documented as part of the methods or noted as
        a `context` or under `measurement_remarks`. Leaflet area can alternatively
        be mapped to the trait `leaflet_area`. It is most common for leaf area measurements
        to include the petiole; the measurement methods should indicate if the petiole
        is included in or excluded from the leaf area measurements. For terete leaves,
        leaf area should still be recorded as the 2-dimensional projected area.

        or leaf analogue (leaflet, cladode, phyllode).
      comments: This trait includes measurements of leaves and leaf analogues, including
        leaflets, cladodes, and phyllodes. When a measurement is made on a leaf analogue,
        the tissue measured should be documented as part of the methods or noted as
        a `context` or under `measurement_remarks`. Leaflet dry mass can alternatively
        be mapped to the trait `leaflet_dry_mass`. It is most common for leaf dry
        mass measurements to include the petiole; the measurement methods should indicate
        if the petiole is included in or excluded from the leaf dry mass measurements.

        (leaf base [PO:0020040]).;Length of a leaf or a leaf analogue, from the leaf
        apex to the leaf axil (base), including the petiole.
      comments: If a leaf analogue (leaflet, cladode, or phyllode) is measured instead
        of a true leaf, this should be noted as a `context` or under `measurement_remarks`.

      description: A leaf morphology trait [TO:0000748] which is the ratio [PATO:0001470]
        of the leaf dry [PATO:0001824] mass [PATO:0000125] to the leaf [PO:0025034]
        area [PATO:0001323], measured on an entire leaf, including the entire leaf
        lamina [PO:0020039] and the petiole [PO:0020038].;The ratio of leaf dry mass
        to leaf area, measured on an entire leaf including the petiole; LMA. (The
        inverse of specific leaf area, SLA.)
      comments: Leaf mass per area includes measurements submitted as `specific_leaf_area`
        (SLA); they are simply inverted. Leaf mass per area is explicitly measured
        on an entire leaf, including the petiole. Measurements made on a piece of
        the leaf lamina, excluding petiole and midrib, are a separate trait `leaf_lamina_mass_per_area`.
        If measurements are made on the entire leaf lamina, but the petiole is excluded,
        this should be noted in the methods or under `measurement_remarks`.

      description: A seed morphology trait [TO:0000184] which is the dry [PATO:0001824]
        mass [PATO:0000125] of a mature [PATO:0001701] seed [PO:0009010].;Dry mass
        of a mature seed, including both oven dried and air-dried samples.
      comments: Standard methods people will have used to dry seeds include, 'fresh'
        (at dispersal, mature); 'air dried' (at local ambient conditions); 'seed bank
        air dried' (to 15% relative humidity); and 'oven dried' (>100 deg C for a
        set number of hours; e.g. seed bank standard is 103 deg C for 17 hours). It
        is expected that some observations in AusTraits mapped onto â€˜seed_dry_mass'
        will actually include both the seed and some dispersal tissue, if the two
        cannot easily be separated; these should be mapped to 'diaspore_dry_mass'.

      description: A leaf shape trait [TO:0000492] which is inclusive [NCIT:C166400]
        categories describing the shape [PATO:0000052] of a leaf [PO:0025034] as broad,
        needle-like, or scale-like.;Variable distinguishing between general leaf form
        (shape) categories.
      comments: Terms identifying the plant organ responsible for photosynthesis are
        mapped to the trait `plant_photosynthetic_organ`, while `leaf_form_general`
        only includes terms pertaining to the general form of the leaf. The trait
        `leaf_shape` provides detailed vocabulary to describe a leaf's shape.
      type: categorical
      allowed_values_levels:
        broadleaf: Flat leaf lamina, regardless of whether the leaves are or are not
          toothed, lobed, or compound.
        leafless: An adult stage plant that lacks leaves throughout the year.
        needle: Needle or awl-shaped leaf that is generally 3-dimensional.

      description: A plant structure morphology trait [TO:0000839] which is the primary
        [NCIT:C25251] organ [PO:0009008] or tissue [CARO:0000043] a plant [PO:0000003]
        uses for photosynthesis [GO:0015979], most commonly a leaf [PO:0025034], cladode
        [PO:0025354], or phyllode [PO:0025335].;Trait indicating a plant's primary
        photosynthetic organ or tissue.
      comments: This trait is not intended to record the presence of primary versus
        secondary photosynthetic organs; only the primary photosynthetic organ should
        be keyed in. Many of the allowable values for this trait are frequently included
        under `leaf type` or `leaf form`. Here, we separate terms pertaining to the
        general form of the leaf (in the trait `leaf_type`) from those identifying
        the plant organ responsible for photosynthesis.
      type: categorical
      allowed_values_levels:
        cladode: A photosynthetic shoot, regardless of form, that functions as a leaf.
          For example, cacti pads and Casuarina articles. (Synonyms, article, phylloclade,
          cladophyll)
        leaf: A true leaf, including both laminar and needle-shaped leaves.
        non-photosynthetic_plant: A plant that lacks any photosynthetic organs.
        phyllode: A flattened bladelike petiole. (Synonyms, switch plant)

    plant_growth_form:
      label: Plant growth form
      description: A whole plant [PO:0000003] phenotype [NCIT:C16977] trait that summarises
        different components of a whole plant's shape [PATO:0000052] and structure
        [PATO:0000141] into general groups [NCIT:C43359]. Characters that contribute
        to the plant form categories include the height [PATO:0000119] of the vegetative
        shoot system [PO:0025607], the distribution of leaves [PO:0025034] along the
        plant stem [PO:0009047], and the position [PATO:0000140] and count [NCIT:C25463]
        of stems and/or leaves relative to the ground surface.;The form of a plant,
        capturing a general sense of plant height and shape, which parts of a plant
        are woody versus herbaceous, the number of stems arising at ground level,
        and the distribution of leaves relative to the main stem.
      comments: This definition of plant growth form is narrower than what is used
        by many other references. Here, information pertaining to where a plant grows
        is captured by `plant_growth_substrate`. Terminology about the shape and length
        of stems and distribution of leaves is included in `stem_growth_habit`. An
        indication of whether a plant is parasitic is presented in `parasitic`. Included
        in the list of plant growth forms are two terms that are exclusively used
        to describe Australian plants, mallee and hummock, and one, tussock, that
        is an important growth form of Australian grasses, but globally used less
        frequently.
      type: categorical
      allowed_values_levels:
        basal_large: A plant whose leaves form a distinctly large basal tuft or rosette,
          including large acaulescent monocots and cycads.
        climber: Plant that climbs up another plant's stem or branches, rather than
          being able to support itself. Term used only if datasets do not specify
          if a climbing plant is herbaceous (a vine) or woody (a liana).
        climber_herbaceous: Herbaceous plant that climbs up another plant's stem or
          branches, rather than being able to support itself. This is usually synonymous
          with `vine`. Types of climbers (scrambling, twining) are captured under
          the trait `plant_climbing_mechanism`. (Synonyms, vine)
        climber_woody: Woody or thick-stemmed (>2 cm) plant that climbs up another
          plant's stem or branches, rather than being able to support itself. This
          is usually synonymous with `liana`. Woody climbers generally use hooks,
          tendrils, and/or adventitious roots to climb; the climbing mechanisms used
          by a taxon are captured under the trait `plant_climbing_mechanism`. (Synonyms,
          liana)
        fern: A taxonomic grouping; ferns are vascular plants that reproduce via spores.
        geophyte: Subcategory of herb, specifically referring to plants that survive
          the winter/dry season as an organ (rhizome, bulb, corm, or tuber) buried
          in dry soil, with all leaves dying back each year.
        graminoid: Herbaceous plant with a grass-like morphology that is within the
          order Poales. Taxa both with and without a tussock form are mapped to this
          term. This term is most frequently applied to three large monocot families,
          Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae, but the term could apply to other taxa
          within Poales with a grass-like morphology, including narrow, linear leaves
          and non-showy flowers, including Restionaceae, Centrolepidaceae, Anarthriaceae,
          and Ecdeiocoleaceae. Taxa outside Poales with a grass-like morphology should
          be designated as `herbs` and also have the term `tufted` mapped to the trait
          `stem_growth_habit`.
        graminoid_not_tussock: A subcategory of graminoid, indicating a plant which
          explicitly lacks a tussock morphology, with the leaves not growing in tufts.
        herb: A seed-bearing plant which does not have a woody above-ground stem;
          when available this term has been divided into more detailed terms. (Synonyms,
          forb)
        hummock: Plant that grows as a dense mound up to 1 metre in height. The term
          generally applies only to species within the genera Triodia that form such
          mounds and these are considered a distinctive and uniquely Australian growth
          form.
        lycophyte: A taxonomic grouping that includes quillworts, clubmosses, and
          selaginella.
        mallee: Refers to Eucalyptus species which are small trees that form a large
          lignotuber. They have multiple stems arising at or near ground level and
          regenerate from the lignotuber following fire.
        palmoid: Plant that bears a rosette-like canopy of typically large, often
          compound leaves atop a usually thick (pachycaulous), columnar, unbranched
          or little-branched stem. Palms, tree ferns, trunked cycads, trunked grass-trees,
          and Pandanus are mapped to this term. (Synonyms, rosette-tree, palm, grass-tree)
        shrub: A woody plant that is distinguished by NOT being a tree, due to one
          of more of the following characteristics, 1) they are less than 8 metres
          in height; 2) if a plant community includes trees, the shrubs are shorter
          than the surrounding trees and not part of the canopy; 3) in comparison
          to trees, the leaves are more distributed along the entire trunk; 4) the
          plant has multiple relatively narrow stems arising at or near ground level.
          The definition of `shrub` is complex, as there are many single-stemmed shrubs
          within Australia and many taxa that are described in the taxonomic literature
          as a shrub or small tree.
        subshrub: A plant that is only woody at the base, with the remainder of the
          stems regenerating yearly. This term is not meant to encompass short-lived
          plants that are only borderline woody. (Synonyms, suffrutescent)
        tree: A tall, woody, perennial plant, usually with a single main trunk, and
          its leaves predominantly elevated above the ground surface.
        tussock: A subcategory of graminoid, which is a plant where many shoots from
          the basal meristem form prominent tufts.

      type: categorical
      allowed_values_levels:
        aerophyte: Plant that obtains moisture and nutrients from the air and rain,
          resting on other plants or the ground surface.
        chamaephyte: Plant whose perennating buds are on persistent shoots that do
          not extend more than 50 cm above the soil surface. These are normally woody
          perennials.
        cryptophyte: Plant whose perennating buds are subterranean or under water.
          This grouping can be further divided into geophyte, helophyte, and hydrophyte.
        epiphyte: Plant that grows on the surface of another plant.
        geophyte: Plant that perennates as an organ (rhizome, bulb, corm, or tuber)
          buried in dry soil, with all leaves dying back each year; a subcategory
          of cryptophyte.
        helophyte: Plant that perennates as an organ (rhizome, bulb, corm, or tuber)
          buried in marshy or wet soil or lying under water, with buds emerging during
          the growing season and shoots and leaves rising about the water surface;
          a subcategory of cryptophyte. (Synonyms, emergent_hydrophyte)
        hemicryptophyte: Plant whose perennating buds are at or near the soil surface.
        hydrophyte: Plant that perennates as buds or as an organ (rhizome, bulb, corm,
          or tuber) buried in marshy or wet soil or lying under water, with shoots
          emerging during the growing season that remain below or at the water surface;
          a subcategory of cryptophyte.
        phanerophyte: Plant whose perennating buds are on persistent shoots which
          rise at least 50 cm above the soil surface. These are normally woody perennials.
        therophyte: Annual plants whose shoot and root systems die completely at the
          end of flowering and seed production, such that they survive the unfavourable
          cold or dry season in the form of seeds.

        a leaf canopy throughout the year and what environmental cues are associated
        with canopy shedding.
      type: categorical
      allowed_values_levels:
        brevi_deciduous: Plant briefly loses its entire leaf canopy but flushes a
          new leaf canopy almost simultaneously to leaf loss.
        cold_deciduous: Plant loses its entire leaf canopy for part of the year, in
          response to cold.
        deciduous: Plant loses its entire leaf canopy for part of the year, in response
          to either drought or cold.
        drought_deciduous: Plant loses its entire leaf canopy for part of the year,
          in response to drought.
        evergreen: Plant retains a leaf canopy throughout the year.
        facultative_drought_deciduous: Plant sometimes loses its leaf canopy for part
          of the year, in response to drought.
        semi_deciduous: Plant thins, but does not entirely lose, its leaf canopy in
          response to an environmental cue, usually drought.
